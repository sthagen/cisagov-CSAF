A product advisory issued in June 2023 informed customers of this parameter.\n\nAn attacker can successfully exploit these vulnerabilities and could take remote control of the product and potentially insert and run arbitrary code. \nABB requires, as noted in previous security advisories and user documentation, that FLXEON should not be exposed to the internet or any other insecure network.\nNote: In order to exploit an FLXEON, an attacker would need a misconfigured system.\n\nABB strongly advises customers and system integrators to follow the instructions documented in: FBXi, CBXi and ASPECT\u00ae SOLUTIONS, which can be downloaded from the ABB library (See in the reference section).

Please find the latest version of FLXEON firmware on the respective product homepage\n\u2022\tIsolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls and separate them from any general-purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).\n\u2022\tInstall physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\n\u2022\tNever connect programming software or computers containing programming software to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.\n\u2022\tScan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.\n\u2022\tMinimize network exposure for all FLXEON ports and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible directly from the Internet. \n\u2022\tEnsure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system, and firmware patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.\n\u2022\tWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available\nMore information on recommended practices can be found in the following documents: FBXi, CBXi and ASPECT\u00ae SOLUTIONS ((HT0038)\n",
