A product advisory issued in June 2023 informed customers of this already.\nAn attacker who successfully exploits these vulnerabilities could gain unauthorized access and potentially compromise the system's - and log-file -  confidentiality, integrity and availability. \nABB requires, as noted in previous security advisories and user documentation, that ASPECT should not be exposed to the internet or any other insecure network.\nNote: In order to exploit an ASPECT, an attacker would need a misconfigured system.\nABB strongly advises customers and system integrators to follow the instructions documented in: FBXi, CBXi and ASPECT\u00ae SOLUTIONS, which can be downloaded from the ABB library. \n",

Please find the latest version of ASPECT firmware on the respective product homepage\n\n\n\u2022\tIsolate special purpose networks (e.g. for automation systems) and remote devices behind firewalls and separate them from any general-purpose network (e.g. office or home networks).\n\n\n\u2022\tInstall physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your devices, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.\n\n\n\u2022\tNever connect programming software or computers containing programming software to any network other than the network for the devices that it is intended for.\n\n\n\u2022\tScan all data imported into your environment before use to detect potential malware infections.\n\n\n\u2022\tMinimize network exposure for all ASPECT ports and endpoints to ensure that they are not accessible directly from the Internet. \n\n\n\u2022\tEnsure all nodes are always up to date in terms of installed software, operating system, and firmware patches as well as anti-virus and firewall.\n\n\n\u2022\tWhen remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available.\n\n\n\u2022\tAuthorized users shall change all default credentials during commissioning of an ASPECT system. If credentials have not been changed during commission state, ABB advises to change each changeable credential at the earliest. ",
